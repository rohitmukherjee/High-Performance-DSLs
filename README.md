High-Performance-DSLs
=====================

Final Year Project at the National University of Singapore. Final product wil be a DSL for system level testing and report parsing.

Installation
============

1. Please install the following dependencies on your system:

    * scala
    * sbt
    * pip
    * pyyaml module: `pip install pyyaml`
    * git
    * hg version > 3.0.1

2. Clone the repository: 

`git clone https://github.com/rohitmukherjee/High-Performance-DSLs.git`

3. Currently the system already has the existing `run-fast-tests.pl` *hip* and *sleek* tests added to them. However, you will need to point the system to your local hg checkout to the `hg/sleek/hip/working/example/hip/` and
`hg/sleek/hip/working/example/sleek/` directories respectively. 

4. The above step can be performed by opening up 
`src/main/resources/application.conf` in a text - editor of you choice and configuring the directories.

5. Now, just to test whether the system is working - go to the root directory of the repository and run the following
    * sbt "run hip" - *to run hip tests*
    * sbt "run sleek" - *to run sleek tests*
    * sbt "run all" - *to first run sleek and then hip tests*
    * sbt "test" - *to run unit tests*

6. You should now see the project build and then start running tests. You should see output similar to the screenshot below on your screen.

<!-- ![Tests running](/Users/rohitmukherjee/dev/repositories/scalaWorkspace/High-Performance-DSLs/docs/screenshots/sleek.png "Tests Running") -->

![Tests running](/docs/screenshots/sleek.png?raw=true "Tests Running")

7. This setup describes how to run the set of tests on the existing branch and revision in the repository specified.

Modifying Existing Tests
========================

Modifying/Adding Hip Tests
----------------------------
1. All the test invocations for hip are in the file:
`src/main/scala/systemTestingDSL/HipTestSuiteUsage.scala`

2. Just modify the parameters in the test to tweak it. You will notice that the tests are split up into different methods which addTest to the suite, to add more tests you can do this or you can directly write in an addTest in the `run()` method.
    *  The format for the addTest(params...) is addTest("hip", source_file_location, arguments, output_directory_name,output_file_name,test_results)

    *  test_results are of the format: `method_1: SUCCESS/FAIL, method_2: SUCCESS/FAIL, ..., method_n: SUCCESS/FAIL`

    *  Eg:` suite addTest ("hip", BASE_DIR + "infinity/inflist.ss", "--dsd --en-inf", "results", "inflist.out", "remove: SUCCESS, append: SUCCESS")`

Modifying/Adding Sleek Tests
----------------------------
1. All the test invocations for sleek are in the file:
`src/main/scala/systemTestingDSL/SleekTestSuiteUsage.scala`

2. Just modify the parameters in the test to tweak it. You will notice that the tests are split up into different methods which addTest to the suite, to add more tests you can do this or you can directly write in an addTest in the `run()` method.
    *  The format for the addTest(params...) is addTest("sleek", source_file_location, arguments, output_directory_name,output_file_name, test_results)

    *  test_results are of the format: `Fail/Valid, Fail/Valid, Fail/Valid .......`

    *  Eg:  'suite addTest ("sleek", WORKING_DIR + "/sleek/label-basic.slk", " --dis-eps", "results", "label_basic", "Fail, Valid, Valid, Fail")'

Translating code from run-fast-tests.pl
---------------------------------------
The tests in run-fast-tests.pl have been already translated and coded into the existing system. However, if further translation is required, please follow the following instructions.

Due to the complexity of the `run-fast-tests.pl`, there are 2 parser scripts that do parsing from components of run-fast-tests.pl > DSL. 

These scripts can be found in `/old_system/parsers/`. There are 2 parsers - sleek_parser.py and hip_parser.py. The inputs taken by them are there in the script files themselves as comments. 

Examples of these inputs can be found in /old_system/source_translations/. Make sure to change the **INPUT_FILE** field in the scripts based on the name of your input. 

then just run, `python hip_parser.py` or python `sleek_parser.py`. It should print the generated DSL to the console. Just copy this over to the `src/main/scala/systemTestingDSL/SleekTestSuiteUsage.scala` or `src/main/scala/systemTestingDSL/HipTestSuiteUsage.scala` based on whether you are parsing hip/sleek.
